;; Title: DefiTrust - Decentralized Reputation-Based Lending Protocol
;; 
;; Summary: A reputation-based lending protocol built on Stacks that uses dynamic 
;; credit scoring to determine collateral requirements and interest rates.
;;
;; Description: DefiTrust enables transparent, permissionless lending with 
;; algorithmic risk assessment based on on-chain credit history. The protocol rewards 
;; reliable borrowers with increasingly favorable terms while maintaining 
;; robust collateralization for system security. Built specifically for 
;; Stacks Layer 2 with Bitcoin compliance considerations.
